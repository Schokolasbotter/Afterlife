  title: "The Totems\u2026"
  description: "What stands in front of you is one of the Raven King\u2019s totems.
    I found out that he is the one who wants to have control over all spirits. He
    has managed to trap every soul in the same afterlife without letting them proceed
    to Heaven or Hell. His servants tried to kill me when I found out about his plans,
    but I managed to escape and return to this place. His totems contain strange
    powers. They open rifts to other parts of the spirit world. If you wish to find
    your escape, activate all three to use their power."
