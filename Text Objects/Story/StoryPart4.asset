  title: 'The Altar Awaits. '
  description: "I see that you have gone through all the challenges that this place
    offered you so far. Believe me, you haven\u2019t seen much. You have activated
    all totems. The altar is set and you can use it now. Your escape hides in stealing
    one of the Raven King\u2019s feathers. I was lucky enough to do so. Use the power
    of the feather to crack the afterlife and proceed into Heaven. I am looking forward
    to seeing you there. Fare well!"
