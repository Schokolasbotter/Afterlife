  title: Time to Fly
  description: If you are reading this, you have listened to what I have told you
    so far. It is time to show me you can do even better. It was hard to place platforms
    in this river. Spread your wings and glide through the air to reach what is still
    there.
  power: <New Power - after jumping press SPACE again to Glide>
  note: '<NOTE: This power does not require magic. Combine it with the previous two
    to reach platforms that are far away>'
