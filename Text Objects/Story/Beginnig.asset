  title: Welcome to Our Afterlife!
  description: Hello adventurer! I understand that you are wondering what is going
    on. I will explain. You and I live the same afterlife. Your death in the mortal
    world is more than clear. You were going after the magical stone on the disappearing
    island and found it. Unfortunately, you were killed by its protectors. However,
    this does not explain why we both ended up in the same place. Legends say that
    no two people can live the same afterlife. It was difficult for me to understand,
    but I did as time went by. I have left you clues to help you on your journey.
    Find my camp and I will explain more.
