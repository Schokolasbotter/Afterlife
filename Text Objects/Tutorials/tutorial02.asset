  title: Dash through the air!
  description: "Sometimes jumping alone won\u2019t get you to where you need to go.
    I tried my best to build a path in this area but building in water is too difficult.
    Some of the platforms might get destroyed in time. Wood was the only material
    I could use and some of the creatures that followed me could have destroyed some
    of the platforms. Try using your wings to dash forward to get to what is left."
  power: <New Power - press E to Dash>
  note: '<NOTE: You can combine this power with the high jump you got earlier if
    you have enough magic>'
