  title: My Camp.
  description: Hello again. You have found my camp. Probably you are wondering who
    I am, but it does not matter. However, I will tell you what I have been doing
    here. I thought I was living a normal afterlife until uncovering some of the
    secrets of this place. I found other spirits trapped in here as well. I managed
    to find escape and help them. While doing so I was chased by cursed creatures
    and had to build this camp as well as a defence mechanism to save myself. You
    might have encountered one the doors that I constructed to stop the creatures.
    One of the buttons for opening it is in my camp. Further ahead you will encounter
    more of my defences. I have the opening mechanisms hidden across the area. Find
    them and you will be able to move forward.
