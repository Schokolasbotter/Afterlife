2nd Year BSc Games Programming - Games Project 2

Project Description: This project was the most challenging of all my projects. We started as a group of three and were forced to continue as a group of two, which increased workload a lot. The idea for this game was a mix of all our pitches in the beginning of the project. One of our members pitched angels and heaven, another one a narrative game and I suggested a 3D puzzle game. In the end we managed to include everything to varying degrees. Throughout this project I was quite unmotivated as our group was struggling with communication and workload, but I managed to work consistently on it and looking back at it, it is a fun and interesting concept. At the end, my friends really enjoyed playing it and tried to speedrun it as well.

Challenges: The biggest challenge was to keep work consistant for me. As our group had very different attitudes to how important this project was, me and another member had to step up incredibly to make the different deadlines. 

Lessons Learned: Working in 3D Space with 3D assets and working a lot more with prefabs and scriptable objects and using them to our advantage.
